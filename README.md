# Python Modules

This project is used as a practice repository for using Python modules.

### Getting started

1. You can fork this repository over to your namespace/user.
2. Play around as much as you like!

### How I built out this project

1. I created the repository out in Github
2. I cloned down the repository into my projects folder locally: ```git clone <repository ssh url>```
3. I followed a template similar to [CookieCutter](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)
to build the different folders.
4. While developing, I use notebooks in the "notebooks" directory for scratch and building out the code.
   After something is usable, I'll turn around and create a python module in the "project" directory
   that I can then import in.
5. While I'm working, I commit frequently and push as needed:
    ```bash
    git status
    git add <file/directory name>
    git commit -m 'Message about the changes'
    git push
    ```
   There are obviously other advanced git workflows, but these will get your started.

### How to play around with data

1. I downloaded the [titanic data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agconti/kaggle-titanic/master/data/train.csv)
   into a folder called "data" inside the repository at the top level.
2. I always add a .gitignore and update as needed to avoid any weird files (ex: .idea)
   in the repository.
